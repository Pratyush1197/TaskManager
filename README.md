# TaskManager
Task-Manager using React.js, firebase and express.js



## Installation Process
1)Clone the folder

2) Open the folder in your terminal and run npm install to install all the dependencies

3) Install forever globally on your local machine using the command - npm install forever -g Forever helps to let the backend server to run even when it throws any error

4) Create a Database in firebase cloud firestore and copy the api key and other credentials in the dest.js file in src folder(full instructions in presentation file also available)

Note- if the backend does not start from forever then do node server.js inside src folder to get the errors in the console.( I prefer to use forever after debugging the errors if any comes)

Running the app- Run npm run start to start the frontend (cd TaskManager-> npm run start) and in other terminal run - forever start server.js (inside src folder) Your Backend will also start. (cd TaskManager -> cd src -> forever start server.js )

Note- Full instructions with screenshots are present in the presentation file.


## Create Database in Firebase 

We are using firebase cloud firestore for database. Open the firebase google console and make a new project. Now create a database and add a new web app. You can also check the documentation for creating the cloud firestore database.

Copy all the Credentials of new web app which you created and replace it with the placeholders I have used in the dest file which is inside the  src folder.

Go to the Authentication tab and enable the Email/Password as shown in screenshot.



Databse may have not been connected. To do it Go to Databse-> Rules and change the false to true as shown in below screenshot and save the changes



Your Database is connected.

Starting the app-

Run npm run start to start the frontend (cd TaskManager-> npm run start) and in other terminal   run -
